Searching for accomodation is quite daunting escpecially if you have stayed with your family your entire life. I am just writing my expericne cause i think i will get dementia one day. but you can use this for your information. 

We reached out to alot  of people over reddit and Yocket Chat and other forums, to make SJSU Uni whatsapp groups, so there are more than 8/9 unofficial whatsapp groups, however few seniors from ISO created a whatsapp group, that needed verfication before joining in. However, before that we created a google forms, which gave us a sheet of information of all students, their prefernces. So we could contact them via email or whatsapp, ill add the google forms format as well. I would suggest to do the same, it will give you a chance to interact with your peer group as well, first step to networking. 

Usually people do not start talking about accomodation until they get their visa, but if your visa slot is after may15th , highly recommend making a group first, atleast with people who have slots before that, so they can start researching accomodation. Another place where  people usually put out posts is the SAMMY app.


First of all if you havent already:
1. Get your Visa sorted, (Check my Visa page as well)
2. Know your budget lower limit and upper limit.
3. Use the google sheet (highly recommended as you can filter people out), or cold message people from whatsapp group to find roomates.
4. Make your groups with your roomates, its fine even if few you didnt get your visa yet.


SJSU is located in San Jose Downtown, Downtown initself in most US cities are known for not being safe. Its the same here as well. But if you mind your busineess you are going to UNi to study and go back to your accomodation you should be good, if not try to travel in groups. 

PS: I am sitting in India while typing this so not sure of the information.

First of all I would definelty suggest to do your own research before going to any blogs or seniors, as it might either be outdated or biased in terms of opionns.

I will go ahead and give you details on the set up that is used in my house. We are 4 people (all Male), we are specifically looking for 2 bedrooms and 2.5 bath rooms.
- 1 Bedroom 1 Bathroom: Shared among 2 people
- 1 Bedroom 1 Bathroom: Private Room (Shower is shared with person in hall room)
- Hall room 0.5 Bathroom: Is taken by 1 person who shared just the shower with ^.


The reason we took this setup is because we do not want to fight and quarrell over silly things, lesser people lesser opionins and lesser overlap or difference in opions. Also although the rooms are separate the kitchen is shared, so we want to keep stuff clean. 

Keep in mind San Jose is notriusly costly, the legal maximum accopancy in a 2b2.5b is 5(which is still alot), but there are some people who live proabbaly 7 people. 

Now this amount is variable and differs from season , during the fall and spring intakes, the costs of these leases rise up signficantly.

Points to note:
* Keep your name in the lease, USCIS needs to know where you live and your permanent residence address. 
* All/Most places require you to have income, since we are international students, our i20 living expenses count as income for the year. So while checking the place, get to know the required amount for the entire flat. Ideally its 100K total income, (my i20 amount shows arounnd 26K, which allows 4 people to stay in a house)
